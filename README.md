# mobile-friendly-gradient
Gradient background simulating background-attachment: fixed for mobile browsers. Technique inspired by this [freeCodeCamp.org CodePen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/VPaoNP).

# Background and Rationale
According to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/background-attachment), 40.8% of Australian tracked browsers cannot use background-attachment: fixed. These browsers are all on mobile platforms, most notably iOS (all browsers on iOS are required to use Safari's WebKit engine). With mobile internet usage becoming increasingly prevalent, the user experience of mobile users cannot be ignored.
